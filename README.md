# Trying out HTMX

A simple todo app using HTMX.

It's currently static, there's no db.
Only one todo item is added / deleted.

## Tech

- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) as server for various routes as well as serving initial static HTML.
- [Pico.css](https://picocss.com/) library for minimal css styling.
