# Trying out HTMX

A simple todo app using HTMX.

It's currently a static app, as there's no db.

For demonstration purposes, only one todo item is -

- initially fetched via GET call
- added via POST call
- deleted via DELETE call

## Tech

- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) as server for various routes as well as serving initial static HTML.
- [Pico.css](https://picocss.com/) library for minimal css styling.
